# Iris Classification Project

This project involves the classification of the Iris flower dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify the species of an Iris flower based on these features.

Key steps in this project include:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature selection
- Model training using various algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization
